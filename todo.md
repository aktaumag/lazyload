# TODO

## Coming next

-   Probably introduce the `reset()` method (public for all, static for one image).
    Check how LazyLoad behaves when a page was updated using DOM morphing.
    If only the data-attributes were updated, how do one forces LazyLoad to read from them again?

## Test

-   Test more modules and functions, coverage!!!
-   Test native `img`, native `iframe`, alone or in conjunction with `video`s.

Test more modules

-   [ ] autoinitialize
-   [ ] purge
-   [ ] reveal
